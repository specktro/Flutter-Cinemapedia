# Cinemapedia
## Description
Cinemapedia is your ultimate companion for discovering and exploring the world of cinema. Powered initially by the extensive Movie Database (TMDB) API, this application provides a rich and engaging experience for movie enthusiasts.

## Development Setup
1. To run this project locally, you will need to provide your own API key for The Movie Database (TMDB). We recommend copying the `.env.template` file and remove the `.template` extension. Then, open the `.env` file to store this key securely and keep it out of version control.
2. Add your API Key to `THE_MOVIEDB_KEY` key.
